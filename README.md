# Port Scanning Application

## Overview

This project is a **Port Scanning Application** built using Python, Docker, and Jenkins. It scans a specified range of ports on a target IP address to determine which ports are open or closed. This application can be used for network security assessments and monitoring.

## Features

- Efficient port scanning using Python's socket programming and multithreading.
- Containerized application using Docker for easy deployment.
- CI/CD pipeline integration with Jenkins for automated builds and testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For developing the port scanning logic.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application.
- **Jenkins**: For continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- **Concurrent Futures**: To handle multiple threads for efficient scanning.
